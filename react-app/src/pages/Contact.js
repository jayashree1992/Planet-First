                And it is one of the most serious problems that not only affect the environment but also human beings. 
                It affects human in several ways but in simple language, we can say that it causes many diseases and disasters that destroy life on earth."

                Yes, we can stop these climatic changes but for that, 
                every one of us has to come forward and has to adapt ways that can reduce and control our bad habits that affect the environment. 
                We have to the initiative and make everyone aware of the climatic changes."

                content = "“Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. 
                “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, 
                including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; 
                and shifts in flower/plant blooming times."

                content = "“Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. 
                “Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still. 
                Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today, global warming would continue to happen for at least several more decades, 
                if not centuries."

                the past few decades."

                content = "Ice cores are scientists’ best source for historical climate data. 
                Other tools for learning about Earth’s ancient atmosphere include growth rings in trees, which keep a 
                rough record of each growing season’s temperature, moisture and cloudiness going back about 2,000 years. 
                Corals also form growth rings that provide information about temperature and nutrients in the tropical ocean. 
                Other proxies, such as benthic cores, extend our knowledge of past climate back about a billion years into the past."
